# Obsidian Config
Contains all of my globally-useful Obsidian config, plugins, and config for those plugins

Filestructure matches that of an Obsidian vault, so this can be copied directly into an Obsidian vault to use.
`.obsidian` folder should be in the root of the vault, with the plugins folder inside it.
